# Portal 2 Recreation on ASW
#### Based off https://github.com/NicolasDe/AlienSwarm (ASW with some fixes and VPC)

## What is this project?
This project is my attempt to remake quite a lot of Portal 2 on the ASW branch of Source 1.

The whole thing is entirely for educational and non-commercial purpose so... hopefully it should be okay.

## Why would you do this, are you crazy?!
I just wanted something to do that would occupy my time and I thought it was a fun project.

## Okay, so what are the benefits of this?
It means I can experiment with portals and stuff with Portal 2 assets and have full access to the code and maybe make a little project with it - non-profit of course.

## Will this ever get finished...?
Probably not, I'm quite lazy.
